### Examples of AI Reasoning:

**Billy (HIGH):**
> "Billy's high scores across all dimensions allow for advanced and challenging activities that match his developmental level. The extra Resilience activity addresses his relatively lowest score (7.4) to strengthen this foundational skill for continued growth."

**Sarah (MEDIUM):**
> "Sarah's high scores in Self-Direction, Awareness, and Knowledge are matched with appropriately challenging activities designed for high performers. The additional Purpose activity addresses her lowest dimension score to help strengthen her sense of direction and meaning."

**Clare (LOW):**
> "Clare's resilience is her lowest dimension at 2.9, so she receives two resilience activities focused on energy management and building reliable habits. All selected activities are beginner-level and designed for average-performing students, matching her overall 3.3 score across dimensions."
