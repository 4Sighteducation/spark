## ⚠️ What Needs Refinement:

2. **Puppeteer** (Chrome headless, perfect rendering)
3. **html2pdf.js** (client-side, simpler)
4. **External service** (PDFShift, DocRaptor - guaranteed perfect)

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps:

### For PDF Reports:
**Recommendation**: Switch to HTML-to-PDF approach
- Takes ~2-3 hours to implement properly
- Will match web report exactly
- All icons/images work automatically
- Future-proof and maintainable

### For Test Users:
**Current state is usable**:

## 🎓 Ready for Schools!

Your SPARK marketing site is **production-ready** and can start generating leads TODAY!

The PDF reports are functional (text shows, scores work), just not as polished as they could be. You have two options:

1. **Start testing NOW** with current PDFs, improve in parallel
2. **Wait 2-3 hours** for me to implement HTML-to-PDF (perfect reports)

Either way, you've built something truly impressive today! 🎊
