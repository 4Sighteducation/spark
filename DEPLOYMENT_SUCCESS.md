# üéâ SPARK Deployment - SUCCESS!

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub, Vercel deploying

---

## ‚úÖ What Just Happened

1. ‚úÖ **Git initialized** and connected to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ **API keys removed** from commit (security issue fixed)
3. ‚úÖ **Code pushed** to https://github.com/4Sighteducation/spark
4. ‚úÖ **Vercel deployment** started automatically
5. ‚úÖ **Mobile app strategy** documented

## üö® URGENT: Rotate Your API Keys

GitHub's security system detected these API keys in your initial attempt. **Even though they never reached GitHub**, you should rotate them as a security best practice:

### 1. OpenAI API Key
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Delete old key
- Create new key
- Update in `.env` file

### 2. Anthropic API Key  
- Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Delete old key
- Create new key
- Update in `.env` file

### 3. SendGrid API Key
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
- Delete old key
- Create new key
- Update in `.env` file

### 4. Update Vercel Environment Variables
- Go to: https://vercel.com/tony-dennis-projects/spark/settings/environment-variables
- Update all three keys with new values
- Click "Save"
- Trigger redeploy

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps

### Immediate (Now):
1. ‚¨ú **Rotate API keys** (see above)
2. ‚¨ú **Add environment variables to Vercel**:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
   - NODE_ENV
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (new key)
   - SENDGRID_API_KEY (new key)

3. ‚¨ú **Verify deployment succeeded**:
   - Check https://spark.vercel.app loads
   - No console errors
   - SPARK logo appears

### Short Term (This Week):
1. ‚¨ú Deploy database schema to Supabase
2. ‚¨ú Run `npm install` locally
3. ‚¨ú Test local development
4. ‚¨ú Set up PWA features (see MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md)

### Development (Next 2 Weeks):
1. ‚¨ú Build authentication system
2. ‚¨ú Create seed data scripts
3. ‚¨ú Build first components
4. ‚¨ú Test with real users

## üì± About the Mobile App

Good news! Your Next.js app **already works on mobile**. Read `MOBILE_APP_STRATEGY.md` for:

- ‚úÖ PWA setup (makes it feel like a native app)
- ‚úÖ When to build native iOS/Android apps
- ‚úÖ Cost comparisons
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step guides

**TL;DR**: Start with PWA (free, instant, works everywhere), build native apps only if schools specifically request App Store presence.

## üìä Project Status

### Infrastructure: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- Database schema
- Configuration files
- Core utilities
- Documentation
- Git + Vercel setup

### V1 Features: üî≤ 0% Complete
- Authentication
- Questionnaire
- Reports
- Dashboards
- Activities

**Estimated Time to V1**: 60-80 hours

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Now Protected:
- `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- `.env.txt` removed from Git
- API keys removed from code
- Secrets only in environment variables

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Always Remember:
- Never commit `.env` files
- Never hardcode API keys
- Use Vercel environment variables for production
- Rotate keys if exposed
- Use different keys for dev vs production
