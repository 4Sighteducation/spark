## 🤖 AI INTEGRATION HIGHLIGHTS

**Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4** successfully:
- Analyzes student profiles across 5 dimensions
- Considers score bands and overall achievement
- Matches activities to difficulty levels
- Balances time across 6 activities
- Focuses on areas of greatest need
- Provides clear educational reasoning

**Example AI Reasoning (Billy):**
> "Billy's high scores across all dimensions allow for advanced and challenging activities that match his developmental level. The extra Resilience activity addresses his relatively lowest score (7.4) to strengthen this foundational skill for continued growth."

**Example AI Reasoning (Clare):**
> "Clare's resilience is her lowest dimension at 2.9, so she receives two resilience activities focused on energy management and building reliable habits. All selected activities are beginner-level and designed for average-performing students, matching her overall 3.3 score across dimensions."

## 🎓 LEARNINGS FROM TODAY

**Technical:**
1. Next.js 14 App Router + Supabase auth-helpers has session timing issues
2. Client-side auth is more reliable for immediate session access
3. RLS policies must never reference their own table (infinite recursion!)
4. UUID format matters (only 0-9, a-f allowed)
5. Suspense boundaries required for useSearchParams

**Workflow:**
1. Test accounts in actual Supabase (not SQL) speeds development
2. Diagnostic pages save hours of debugging
3. Incremental testing prevents compounding errors
4. Client-side first, then add server optimization later

**AI:**
1. Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 excellent for educational reasoning
2. Fallback logic essential when AI APIs fail
3. AI reasoning adds significant value to user experience
