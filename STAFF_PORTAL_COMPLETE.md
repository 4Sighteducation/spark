## 💡 TECHNICAL NOTES

**Client-Side Pattern:**
```typescript
// Get session
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()

// Get profile with role
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', session.user.id)
  .single()

// Role-based query
if (profile.primary_role === 'head_of_year') {
  // Filter by year
}
```

**Modal Pattern:**
```typescript
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
const [selectedStudent, setSelectedStudent] = useState(null)

// Trigger
<button onClick={() => {
  setSelectedStudent(student)
  setIsOpen(true)
}}>View</button>

// Component
<Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)} />
```

**Color Function:**
```typescript
function getScoreColor(score: number | null): string {
  if (score === null) return 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-400'
  if (score >= 7) return 'bg-green-100 text-green-700'
  if (score >= 5) return 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700'
  if (score >= 3) return 'bg-orange-100 text-orange-700'
