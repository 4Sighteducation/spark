# SPARK Website Enhancements - Plan

## Issues to Address:

### 1. ✅ Questionnaire Loading (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Form tried to save to API before showing questionnaire
- **Solution**: Simplified to just validate and show questionnaire
- **Status**: Fixed - form now opens questionnaire immediately

### 2. Logo Enhancements
- **Current**: 300x300px with some glow
- **Goal**: Larger (500x500px) with spectacular glow effects
- **Plan**: Increase size, add more glow layers, enhance animations

### 3. "What is SPARK" Section Redesign
- **Current**: 3-column grid (uneven on some screens)
- **Goal**: Better layout with hover popups showing example questions
- **Plan**: 
  - 2-column grid for better balance
  - Tooltip/modal on hover with 2-3 example questions per dimension
  - More visual hierarchy

### 4. Add Activities Showcase
- **Goal**: Show 2-3 example activities from each dimension
- **Plan**: New section after "How It Works" with activity cards

### 5. Promotional Banner
- **Goal**: "First 20 schools get free access for first year"
- **Plan**: Sticky top banner or prominent hero section badge

### 6. Add Report Screenshots
- **Goal**: Show what teachers/students will see
- **Plan**: New section with SPARKRPTa.png showcasing real reports

### 7. Enhanced Research Section
- **Goal**: More detailed psychometric validation
- **Plan**: Expand with specific alpha scores, item loadings, factor analysis details
