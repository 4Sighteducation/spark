## 🎯 ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **Client-Side Auth Pattern:**
- All portal pages use client-side Supabase
- Session management via `supabase.auth.getSession()`
- RLS policies provide security
- No middleware redirects (caused timing issues)
- Works reliably with Next.js 14 App Router

**Why:** Server-side auth-helpers had session timing issues

### **AI via API Routes:**
- All Anthropic calls server-side only
- API keys never exposed to browser
- Rate limiting possible
- Usage tracking enabled
- Secure and scalable

**Why:** Browser AI client would expose API keys

### **Component Structure:**
- Page components fetch data client-side
- Reusable UI components in `/components/portal/`
- Activity components in nested folders
- Clear separation of concerns

  })
})
