# SPARK Mobile App Strategy

## Current Setup: Progressive Web App (PWA)

Your SPARK platform is built with Next.js, which means it's **already mobile-ready** out of the box!

### ‚úÖ What You Have Now:
- Responsive design (works on phones/tablets)
- Can be "installed" as a PWA (Add to Home Screen)
- Works offline (with service worker)
- Push notifications (with setup)
- Full-screen app experience

### üéØ Recommended Approach:

## Phase 1: PWA (Now - FREE) ‚≠ê **START HERE**

**Timeline**: Already built-in!  
**Cost**: $0  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours setup

### Why PWA First?
- ‚úÖ **One codebase** for web, iOS, and Android
- ‚úÖ **No app store approval** needed
- ‚úÖ **Instant updates** (no user downloads)
- ‚úÖ **Works offline**
- ‚úÖ **80% of native app features**
- ‚úÖ **SEO benefits** (unlike native apps)

### PWA Setup (Quick):

1. **Add PWA manifest** (already done in Next.js)
2. **Add service worker** for offline support
3. **Configure app icons** (use your SPARK logo)
4. **Enable "Add to Home Screen"**

**Result**: Students tap "Add to Home Screen" ‚Üí SPARK appears like a native app!

## Phase 2: Native Apps (Later - When Needed)

**Timeline**: 3-6 months  
**Cost**: ¬£3,000-5,000 development  
**Annual Cost**: ¬£99 (Apple) + ¬£25 (Google)

### When to Build Native Apps:

Build native apps **only if** you need:
- Advanced device features (biometrics, background processing)
- App Store presence for discoverability
- Offline-first complex functionality
- Enhanced performance for intensive features

### Technology Options:

#### Option A: React Native (Recommended) ‚≠ê
- **Pros**: 90% code reuse from web, single team, fast development
- **Cons**: Requires separate repo, some platform-specific code
- **Timeline**: 2-3 months for V1
- **Example**: Same components, just wrapped for mobile

#### Option B: Capacitor (Easiest)
- **Pros**: Wraps your existing Next.js app, minimal changes
- **Cons**: Performance slightly lower than React Native
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for V1
- **Example**: Your web app, packaged as native

#### Option C: Native (iOS/Android separately)
- **Pros**: Best performance, full platform features
- **Cons**: 2x development cost, 2x maintenance, 2x bugs
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months
- **Not recommended** unless you have specific native requirements

## PWA Setup Guide (Do This Next!)

### Step 1: Create PWA Manifest

Create `public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "SPARK - Student Mindset Assessment",
  "short_name": "SPARK",
  "description": "Psychometric assessment for Key Stage 3 students",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "theme_color": "#E91E8C",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-72x72.png",
      "sizes": "72x72",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-96x96.png",
      "sizes": "96x96",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-128x128.png",
      "sizes": "128x128",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-144x144.png",
      "sizes": "144x144",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-152x152.png",
      "sizes": "152x152",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-384x384.png",
      "sizes": "384x384",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Link Manifest in Layout

Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
<head>
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#E91E8C" />
  <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
  <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
  <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" />
  <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="SPARK" />
  <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/icon-192x192.png" />
</head>
```

### Step 3: Generate App Icons

Use your SPARK logo (`assets/SPARK Logo.png`):

1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload SPARK logo
3. Download icon pack
4. Place in `public/icons/`

### Step 4: Add Service Worker (Optional - for offline)

Install next-pwa:
```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

Update `next.config.js`:
```js
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
})

module.exports = withPWA({
  // your existing config
})
```

### Step 5: Test PWA

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Open on mobile browser
3. Tap "Share" ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"
4. SPARK appears as native app! üéâ

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Initial Cost | Annual Cost | Maintenance | Users Reach |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **PWA** | ¬£0 | ¬£0 | Low | 100% (all devices) |
| **React Native** | ¬£3,000-5,000 | ¬£124/year | Medium | 100% (needs stores) |
| **Native (iOS+Android)** | ¬£10,000-15,000 | ¬£124/year | High | 100% (needs stores) |

**Recommendation**: Start with PWA, upgrade to React Native only if schools specifically request App Store presence.

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need App Store approval for PWA?**  
A: No! PWA is just a website that looks/feels like an app.

**Q: Can students install SPARK without App Store?**  
A: Yes! They visit your URL and tap "Add to Home Screen".

**Q: Will it work offline?**  
A: Yes, if you add a service worker (optional).

**Q: Is PWA as fast as native?**  
A: 95% as fast. Most users won't notice the difference.

**Q: When should I build native apps?**  
A: Only if schools specifically require App Store presence or you need advanced device features.

---

**Recommendation**: Build PWA features now (2-3 hours), launch, gather feedback, decide on native apps later.

Your Next.js app is **already 80% of the way there**! üöÄ
